<p >With the introduction of the "Magnavox Odyssey" in 1972, the first game console appeared that could be connected to a TV. Even though it was rather awkward to use - the playing field had to be glued to the TV in the form of a template in order to play - this console made digital gaming suitable for the masses.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, arcades were subsequently established, which made it possible for the general public to play games on machines such as Pong. However, the competitive nature of the game only became possible with the introduction of permanent high score lists. One of the first machines to feature this option was "Sea Wolf" from 1976.</p>
